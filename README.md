# tools
This repository contains various tools that help in the management process of a Stellar Inflation Pool.

# Manager
The manager folder contains a JavaFX application to manually manage fetching current voters, balances and inflation payment via direct signing of the transaction by a single party. This tool is meant to be a temporary solution for the Lumenaut pool until a secure and automated process is in place, but can be used by single inflation pool owners that do not require multisignature handling to decentralize inflation pool responsibilities for what concerns inflation payouts.

The tool is currently under development, and a detailed manual will be written here as soon as the tool is ready to be used.
